                    Depending on the end application, cryocoolers are classified as Stirling, Gifford-McMahon (G-M),
                    Joule-Thomson (J-T) and Pulse Tube Cryocoolers.</p> <br>
                <p class="fs-5 mx-lg-5">Onnes Cryocoolers are highly efficient, reliable with proven efficacy that meets
                    the end clientâ€™s strategic performance requirements. Onnes is a market leader in Joule-Thomson,
                    Stirling Cycle, and Pulse Tube Cryocoolers. Our cryocoolers are used in demanding harsh conditions
                    of defense, military, and space applications. Onnes constantly innovates to push the technological
                    limits of cryocoolers to make them suited for the macroscopic and miniature applications on the
                    ground, space, and water.</p>
