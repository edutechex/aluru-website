                <h5>Co-Founder & CEO</h5>
                <p class="py-4">Ramâ€™s background is in low-temperature physics and quantum material science engineering, he holds a
                    Ph.D.
                    from the Max Planck Institute, Germany and Uni. St Andrews, UK for working on high-temperature
                    superconductors and semiconductor electronics at cryogenic temperatures such as 1.6 K and 30 mK.
                    After
                    his Ph.D., Ram worked as a Research Scientist at the Leiden Institute of Physics in the Netherlands.
                    Apart from having the tech edge in cryogenics and superconducting electronics, Ram also built an
                    EdTech
                    company from scratch and managed Bluetooth technology projects in Industry 4.0. During his doctoral
                    studies, Ram has published his research findings in prestigious journals such as Science, Nature and
                    he
                    is an avid science communicator and takes an active part in science outreach activities.</p>
